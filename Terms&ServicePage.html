        <h2>2. Botlifter's Services and Rights</h2>
        
        <p>
            1. Botlifter provides the key components for its users to gain a competitive advantage against other consumers while trying to buy items online due to the covid shortage or limited items in stock.             
<br><br>2. The extent of the platform Content and the options to use (the “License”) depend on the type of account you selected. There is a difference between a free account (see Section 3), a paid subscription (see Section 4) and a free trial (see Section 5) and a purchase of Audiobook Content (see Section 6). In terms of duration, the license is limited to the validity period of the free account / paid subscription / free trial, however, in case of a purchase of Audiobook Content availability in your account will be, subject to Section 6, unlimited.
<br><br>3. The rights to Botlifter's service and the content distributed through the service are and will remain with Botlifter and /or Botlifter's licensors. The Botlifter software applications and content are licensed to you within the scope of the contractual use. We only grant you a non-exclusive (simple), time-limited right to personal use of the Botlifter service and its contents (however, subject to Section 6, availability of purchased Audiobook Content will be unlimited in your account).
<br><br>4. All Botlifter trademarks as well as our trade names, logos, domain names and other distinctive features of the Botlifter trademark are the sole property of Botlifter. The license does not give you any right to use the Botlifter trademarks, our trade names, logos, domain names or any other distinctive features of the Botlifter trademark, be it for commercial or non-commercial purposes.
<br><br>5. If you do not use a paid service, Botlifter is allowed to show you promotional information on the Platform.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Registering with Botlifter</h2>
        <p>
            1. In order to be able to use Botlifter’s services, a registration with Botlifter is required. Individuals over the age of 18 have the right to register. As a minor, you may only register with Botlifter if you are at least 14 years old and your legal representatives have provided their consent. Botlifter reserves the right to make the use of Botlifter services contingent on proper proof of your identity, your legal age, or your legal representative’s consent.
<br><br>2. The registration itself is free of charge (free account) and does not oblige you to obtain a paid subscription. By registering, you are executing an agreement with Botlifter for a limited, free use of the Platform.
<br><br>3. You can use your e-mail address as well as a password of your choice to register. Alternatively, you may register using a single sign-on service (for example, Facebook login). You can register via our website or after downloading our iOS or Android app.
<br><br>4. Any information required for registration must be complete and correct and always up-to-date. Botlifter has the right to save and process the data you provided during registration, in accordance with the provisions on Data Protection.
<br><br>5. The password used must be kept confidential. Keeping it a secret is solely and fully your responsibility. The Botlifter user account may only be used by you. Any unauthorized use of your user account, as well as any such suspicion to that effect should be communicated to Botlifter immediately.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>4. Executing an Agreement for a Paid Subscription</h2>
        <p>
            1. To be able to fully benefit from Botlifter's services, additional service packages in the form of paid subscriptions (“Subscription Access”) are available to you after registering. These can be purchased for different, and variable periods of time, which you will see in the order options.
            <br><br>2. Botlifter's Subscription Accesses are ad-free, paid subscriptions that allow you to access additional content and features through our mobile and web-based applications. We currently offer the following subscription / service package:
            <br><br>You will have access to the respective services as long as your subscription is valid.
            <br><br>4. You submit a legally binding offer for a fee-based subscription, if you enter the information requested in the online order form and then click on the “Order with obligation to pay” button. By doing so, you submit a legally binding offer for an agreement for a paid subscription. Before submitting your order, you may change and view the data at any time.
            <br><br>5. The contract is concluded when Botlifter issues a notice of acceptance (order confirmation), which will be sent to you by email within a reasonable time. If you purchased your fee-based subscription via Botlifter’s web-based application Botlifter will send the order confirmation to you by email together with the receipt confirmation immediately following your order. If you purchased your fee-based subscription via an in-app purchase (please also see subsection 5) you will receive a receipt confirmation following your order from the third party appstore and Botlifter will send to you the notice of acceptance (order confirmation) by separate email. In both cases, the text of the contract (consisting of the order, the General Terms and Conditions and the order confirmation) will be sent to you by Botlifter on a permanent data carrier (email) (contract confirmation). Your subscription begins on this date. The text of the agreement is saved subject to data protection. Please read our Privacy Statement for information on the collection, use and processing of your data.
            <br><br>6. You can also sign up for a paid subscription through an in-app purchase through our iOS or Android apps or our Amazon Alexa Skill. In order to do this, you must select the desired option on the subscription screen within the app, and a pop-up will appear where you have to enter your password for the third party appstore. As soon as you finish, a pop-up will appear in which you have to confirm the purchase of the subscription again. At this point you can still cancel the process. You should then receive a receipt confirmation from the third party appstore (not directly from Botlifter).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>
            If you are a consumer (i.e., a person completing the legal transaction for purposes that can be predominantly attributed to neither their commercial nor their independent professional activity), you are entitled to a statutory withdrawal right when concluding a distance selling agreement, about which Botlifter provides information below in accordance with the statutory model. Please note that in the case of an in-app purchase, you have a right of withdrawal within the respective app store, i.e., Apple-App-Store, Google Play Store or Alexa Skills Store. A model withdrawal form can be found in Section 7.3.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2>6. Term and Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
            1. The paid subscription for the Subscription Access (see Section 4) will run for at least the term you originally selected and will automatically renew if it is not canceled at least 24 hours before the end of that period.
            <br><br>2.The subscription term will be extended according to the subscription model used so far. You can cancel as instructed below:
<br><br>You can cancel paid subscriptions completed via our web app in the "Settings" menu item of the web app. To do this, you must log in, open the settings in the context menu and click on “Cancel subscription”.
<br><br>A paid subscription completed in our iOS or Android apps or our Amazon Alexa Skill can be canceled in your iTunes, Google Play or Amazon Alexa settings.
<br><br>3. The Subscription Access cancellation takes effect on the day following the last day of your current subscription period and you will be downgraded to the free user agreement (free account). However, once you renew a subscription again, you will be able to access your old status and reading lists. If you wish to delete your entire account, you can do so from the settings in our web apps (see Section 8.3). All data will be deleted irrevocably.
<br><br>4. The right to blocking and cancellation for an important reason due to a good cause remains unaffected by the preceding provisions.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2>7. Change of Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>
            1. Botlifter reserves the right to amend and/or supplement the General Terms and Conditions with effect in the future, provided that this is reasonable for you taking into account Botlifter's interests. If no explicit consent is obtained from you to adapt the General Terms and Conditions, you will be notified by Botlifter of any amendments and/or supplements to the terms and conditions in a timely manner (at least four weeks before the amended General Terms and Conditions enter into force). To this end, Botlifter will send you the new version of the General Terms and Conditions to the e-mail address specified by you in the registration. In this context, Botlifter will expressly point out to you the possibility and deadline for an objection to the new version of the General Terms and Conditions, as well as the consequences, should you not object.
<br><br>2. If you do not object to the applicability of the new version of the General Terms and Conditions within four weeks after receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph (1) of this Section, the new version of the GTC shall be deemed accepted by you.
<br><br>3. If you object to the new version of the General Terms and Conditions in due time, the contractual relationship shall be continued under the previous General Terms and Conditions, but Botlifter may decide to terminate the free user agreement or the paid subscription with effect from the next possible regular termination date.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>8. Final Provisions</h2>
        <p>
            1. If any provision of these General Terms and Conditions is invalid, the remainder of the agreement remains valid. The statutory provisions shall take effect over the invalid regulations.
<br><br>1. The law of the United States Of America shall apply, excluding the provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The legal provisions restricting the choice of law and the applicability of mandatory regulations, in particular of the state in which the customer normally resides as a consumer, remain hereof unaffected.
<br><br>2. If no exclusive legal court of jurisdiction is given, all disputes arising out of or in connection with the contractual relationship shall be settled exclusively by the court at Botlifter’s registered office, thus Berlin, provided that you are a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law or have no general court of jurisdiction in the United States Of America or have moved your (residential) address to non-USA countries subject to the validity of these General Terms and Conditions.
